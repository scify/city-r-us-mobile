# city-r-us-mobile

Part of the [Radical project](http://www.radical-project.eu/) City’R’US brings an innovative way to connect a Municipality with its citizens and motivate citizens to get involved in city issues. With City’R’US, a City council asks its citizens to contribute to missions of common interest that can improve life in the city (points accessible by people with disabilities, something nice to see or do, points of interest, nice walks or bike rides). The citizens’ contributions are publicly displayed on a public map for all to use. What is more, citizens can suggest new missions, report troubles and even get awarded for the involvement.
